# GKTodayScraper
This scraper is used to get Q&amp;As of a month from the site 'www.gktoday.in'. 
You just need to provide the link where links for the Q&A for that month are given.

Eg.: Suppose you want to get all Q&A for March, 2016 then you can just give:

     www.gktoday.in/gk/current-affairs-questions-answers/page/... (whatever page has March,2016 links)
     
It is not yet complete (without interface). If you have any ideas to make it better then ping me.
